# Dev Skills

A plugin marketplace of [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io)-format skills for Claude Code, Codex CLI, Cursor, Gemini CLI, and any other host that speaks the open spec.

`AGENTS.md` (with its `CLAUDE.md` symlink) holds repo-local conventions for editing the skills here — not org-wide agent instructions. Plugin scope is `skills/` only.

Attribution for forked skills: see [`skills/ATTRIBUTION.md`](skills/ATTRIBUTION.md).
