### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* **dependency-review:** dependabot-pr-merge skill removed; superseded by dependency-review.
* plugin identifier changed from matthew-a-carr@matthew-a-carr-skills to dev-skills@matthew-a-carr. GitHub's repo-rename redirect keeps old URLs working, but settings that reference the old marketplace key or plugin name need updating.

## [2.0.0] (2026-05-23)


### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* Plugin renamed from `matthew-a-carr` to `dev-skills`, and the GitHub repo
  from `agent-scripts` to `dev-skills`. Distribution moves under the new
  central `matthew-a-carr` marketplace at `matthew-a-carr/claude-plugins`.
  Skill prefixes change from `matthew-a-carr:<skill>` to `dev-skills:<skill>`.
  Update `enabledPlugins` from `matthew-a-carr@matthew-a-carr-skills` to
  `dev-skills@matthew-a-carr`, and `extraKnownMarketplaces` to point at
  `matthew-a-carr/claude-plugins`. GitHub's repo-rename redirect keeps old
  URLs working for now, but updating refs is recommended.
